If you're interested in collaborations or joining the group, send an email to me (hannah.wauchope[at]gmail.com). Or, if you're interested in a particular group member's work, you'll find their email on the 'People' page.

For students interested in joining the group - make sure your email explains why you're getting in touch with this group specifically, and share a bit about yourself and why you think your research interests are a good fit (and attach a CV!) - this goes for any academic you might be contacting. Most years I'll advertise a DTP (i.e. government funded project) in December that has a particular topic. Outside of this, PhD funding is tight but there are a couple of competitive funding opportunities available for students who have self generated project ideas and are up for a fight. If you think this is you get in touch and we can see what's available!

For postdocs - I'll advertise any funded opportunities on the home page of this website, but if you're interested in applying for independent funding together I'd love to hear from you. [Leverhulme](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships), [1851](https://royalcommission1851.org/fellowships/research-fellowships) and [Marie Curie](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) are good places to look for postdoctoral fellowship options. (NOTE our school at Edinburgh is not accepting Leverhulme applications for the upcoming round)

REMEMBER if considering working with me, or any other P.I., its very important you speak to past and present group members to find out what working within the group is like. All supervisors operate differently (and probably have a fairly different idea of what it looks like from our side verses how students perceive it). Some supervisors are not so great. Its important to be sure you feel happy that the group is a good fit for you! You'll find the emails of my students on the 'People' page, and can normally find students for most P.I.s on their websites or university pages.

### Location

We're based down at the Kings Buildings Campus of the University of Edinburgh, it's about 20mins on the bus south from Waverly Station.
