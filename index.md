This is the research website of me (Hannah Wauchope) and the people I work with at the University of Edinburgh. Our work focuses on how we measure biodiversity and understand humanity's impacts upon it. This includes work understanding the impact of interventions (such as protecting or restoring habitat) on biodiversity, investigating how we use data to track progress towards national and international policy targets, assessing the viability of biodiversity credits - which propose to measure discrete 'units' of nature, and quantifying the impacts of climate change and invasive species on species distributions and abundances.

Much of our work is based on large data sets at large scales, or is focused on developing general methodologies, but many projects are based on local scale field work. Currently group members are working on projects looking at: the impacts of restoration and/or invasive species on habitats in Scotland, Africa, South America and French Polynesia; which protected area management strategies work best in the UK and Ireland; and how climate change in the Arctic is affecting both tundra plants and population dynamics between snowshoe hare and lynx.

The work of this group aims to be as real-world relevant as possible, and we have collaborated with many government and non-government organisations, including The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), WWF, Wetlands International, The Swiss Ornithological Institute, Tree Aid, The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Australian Antarctic Division.

For more information about both current and past projects, see the "Research"" page. And for information about who we all are, see "People". And if you're interested in joining, I'd love to hear from you, see the "Contact" page.
